# CODSOFT
This repository contains my CODSOFT Summer Internship (AI) tasks
1st task is a simple rule-based chatbot
2nd one is a classic tic-tac-toe game using minimax algo
3rd one is a face detector, it uses a pre-trained model to detect faces. Put the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file inside a folder named 'model' and keep it in the same directory as the face-detect.py
